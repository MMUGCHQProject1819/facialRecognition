# FacialRecognition

In this directory we will provide the entirety of the source code in Python for facial recognition on photos/videos/live videos. 

## Still-Photo
 This has been partially implemented via detecting the face, and some specific parts of the face along side it. It outlines either a square or a circle if it has found the specific
 item in the face.

## Live-Photo

## Updates

We are almost finished with finding out the entire face of the person in the image with only the mouth missing.
